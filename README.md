# spatial-linkedscience

[spatial@linkedscience](http://linkedscience.org/spatial/) is a community-driven effort to create methods, vocabularies, tools and data for showing how and why spatial information can efficiently be used in scientific settings.

As a first major step we have developed this access point to (almost) all papers ever published in the major Geographic Information conferences: GIScience, COSIT, ACM GIS, and AGILE. The result can be explored using this website developed by Carsten Ke√üler, Krzysztof Janowicz and Tomi Kauppinen.
